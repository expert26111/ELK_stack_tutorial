# Steps I performed to learn about the ELK stack

For first I have followed this tutorial:
[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS_nHTWZEJ8&ab_channel=OfficialElasticCommunity)]

After extracting the elastic search zip file , I cd into it, cd into bin and run the command elasticsearch.bat but I got an error , so I followed advice from this link [(https://opster.com/analysis/elasticsearch-authentication-of-was-terminated-by-realm/#:~:text=What%20this%20error%20means,i.e.%20until%20authentication%20is%20successful.)]

My password for elastic username is 260790

I have installed on my computer elasticsearch in the form of zip file.
Unzip it in the same file.
